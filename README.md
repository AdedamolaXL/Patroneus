# PATRONEUS

## 1. Project/Purpose
The Investment DAO is the final phase in our roll-out services and its expected outcome of an income-generating community in the marketplace that have fostered camaraderie, collaboration and community building. At this stage member-patrons can pool their resources together and use it to invest in specific socio-political cause and projects that have been identified to be fitting with the community ethos. 
Patroneus is an art investment DAO with a focus on art collection. Patron members pool their resources to collect unique art pieces, support unique artists and causes + even contribute into art institutions. with a focus on protecting the cultural heritage of the burgeoning digital art scene/industry.
  
## 2. Problem
**Problem Statement**: Building a DAO focused on art investements

## 3. Solution
**Solutions**:
Community members as patrons form an investment group (DA0). Investment pools is a way of bringing members resources to achieve the following goals:
  * jointly acquire artworks
  * sponsor specific projects
  * participate in the speeculative art market
  * invest profits from art-sales in liquidity pools designed to pay back members through automatic payouts.
  
## 4. Why Now?
Why not now? Now, we have the power of community and blockchain to collectively acquire expensive artworks. Apart from the fact that art is an asset that accrues profit over time, this also makes it easier for people to support and push minority artists out there.

## 5. Market Size
Currently, the global web3 market size is expected to be valued at US$ 13.4 billion (TAM) by the end of 2022. About 40% of that market size, US$ 4.36 billion (SAM) belongs to NFT. However, with out current resources, we believe we can reach 10% of that, which is US$ 4 million.

Our focus group is the the Millennial - Gen Z generation who possess financial, social resources alongside tech-savviness to navigate the internet. We believe our product and services are self-marketing on their own due to their attractiveness and usefulness to the community. Nevertheless, we aim to use the full power of social media to network and market ourselves using Tik-Tok, You-tube, Instagram, Twitter, etc to engage meaningful discussions and content around art.
 * Community Discovery : Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube
 * Cmmunity Engagement – Discords, Blogs
 * Cmmunity Activation – Patreon, Twitch
 
 The total population of people who fall within the Gen Z and Millenial generations are 4.9B. From that 4.9B, we project that people betwen 18 and 35 will be financially able to collaborate to own artworks - that is about 3B. However, our obtainable market size would be , who are web3 savvy.  
 
## 6. Challenges & Recommendation
* Risk of failure or low adoption of the online learning platform, perharps due to poor learning tools or low reach or attractiveness towards potential learners 
 * Poor community bonding, detached members, not engaged enough
 * Risk of duplication, of doing the same thing, again if the marketplace is not attractive or unique enough
 * Loyalty program not incentivizing enough, too complex, or not broad enough in usecases in case of cross-chain, or off-chain interoperability
 * Fraud in case of investment DAO, or power aggregating in the hands of a few donors in terms of DAO direction.

## 7. Product/Service
**Tezos Applications**:
NFT – Fractionalization for allows for patron-members to pool ther resources together and invest jointly in ownership of artworks, in which each members ownership-share is equal to their contribution to the pool. The community may choose to issue these fractionalized tokens to the contributing members who can then choose to trade with it on secondary markets. NFT fractionaliztion particularly offer higher liquidity opportunities for members.

This usecase can be extended to liquidity pools where investing members can stake their fungible tokens in liquidity pools, yield farming strategies and expected automated payouts into their wallet by making use of existing automated streaming protocols

Finally the incidence of DogeCoin shows their is a possibility of creating a stablecoin backed by expensive artworks using the same principle of NFT fractionalization, the idea is to invest in high quality expensive works of art prefferably classicals that are housed in cultural institutions wrap an NFT around it after acquistion and then fractionalize the token by redistributing the value among DAO members by issuing fungiblle tokens based on it. The idea is that high quality works of art is have a stable and rising curve of valuation which time which makes them an intersting usecase for creating a stablecoin free from volatility,

  * Encourage diversity and encourage members to treat each other in a dignified, sincere manner.

#### Building Relationships with Partner Organizations
  * Research and reach out to:
    * organizations with similar missions, purposes, values
    * organizations with different missions, purposes, values but may have a similar vision, rationale, and objectives to explore potential partnerships with us
    * important community leaders and influencers
  * Look for common links, allies, connections and use them as a basis to bond
  * Attend events, webinars, workshops and use it as an opportunity to bond
  * Engage potential partners in important conversations like:
    * what you each do and ideas for what you each need;
    * ways you can benefit one another;
    * the communities and networks both organizations reach;
    * the strengths you can each offer with regard to a potential partnership;
    * cultural competence and communication styles.
  * Create a statement clearly outlining the partnership’s vision, rationale, and objectives. Also, explain why you are partnering. Be explicit about each partner’s role and assign tasks and responsibilities based on strengths. Begin with smaller tasks and responsibilities, and then increase their size and complexity over time.
  * Establish metrics to track desired activities, outputs, and outcomes (e.g., logic models or fidelity scales). Share relevant data as much as possible.

#### Specific Strategies 
  * Conduct a needs assessment to understand what the (digital) art communitites require the most and focus on that in terms of design for the DAO
    * Collect accurate data, stories, case-studies to get the perfect picture of the reality on ground.
    * Identify the most important issues raised and the most important features needed and implement based on that
    * Let the marketing outreach focus on telling stories
    * Minimize assessment or intake procedures to lessen the bottlenecks for incoming members
